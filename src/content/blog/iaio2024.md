description: Following the event in Bulgaria, a new international competition emerged, hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As new participants, we were welcomed with the same remarkable generosity as in the previous event. While the competition topics largely remained the same, math problems and reinforcement learning were added. The event is taking place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia and one of the country’s most advanced financial hubs.

# <u>International Artificial Intelligence Olympiad (IAIO) 2024</u>

<hr class="border-1 border-t border-tcotta my-0" />

After missing the opportunity to attend the Olympiad in Burgas, I’m deeply honored to have been chosen as a <span class="font-extrabold">deputy leader</span> for the IAIO 2024, which will be held in <span class="font-extrabold">Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</span>. The hospitality and support from the event organizers have been exceptional, assisting everyone with visa options, travel arrangements, and insurance well in advance. The webinars and preparation materials provided have been invaluable in helping students gear up for this international event.

With the recent inclusion of Reinforcement Learning in the Olympiad curriculum, I’ve had the opportunity of guiding students through fundamental RL concepts, from Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to Deep Q Networks. <span class="font-extrabold">This is an incredible opportunity for me to travel and experience a completely new country, immersed in its rich history and vibrant culture.</span> [<span class="font-extrabold" style="color:var(--tcotta)">[IAIO 2024]</span>](https://www.iaio-official.org/)
